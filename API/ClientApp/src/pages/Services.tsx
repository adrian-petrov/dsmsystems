                          Cloud-based solutions can provide a host of benefits
                          compared to the traditional model of on-site systems and
                          hardware. From cost, flexibility, performance, or security

                          The key challenge is to understand the balance between

                          supported in the cloud. We work with our customers to
                          provide the sensible balance for them and to develop and
                          implement plans to migrate services to the cloud, where
                          beneficial. This may be the wholesale moving of
                          infrastructure off-premises or the moving of services to a
                          Software as a Service (SaaS) model.

                          cloud-based services.
